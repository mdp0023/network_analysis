This is the github repository that we are using to document our progress on our resource accessibility model. This repository is currently under consistent development, and users may experience bugs and frequent changes.

Users can refer to our publication for more information: Preisser, M., Passalacqua, P., Bixler, R. P., Boyles, S. (2023). A network-baed analysis of critical resource accessibility during floods. Frontiers in Water, https://doi.org/10.3389/frwa.2023.1278205. 

A standalone documation website is also in production. 

For those interested in using our model and framework in their research or in practice, please feel free to reach out to mattpreisser@gmail.com or matthew.preisser@utexas.edu.
